                    CATDA Football Club (CATDA FC), one of the fast-rising football clubs, was established in 2013 as a fitness club, with a vision of fitness maintenance at Meat Packers (Lufula) or City Abattoir Traders Association by Mr Ndugga Musa.

                <p>
                While participating in the practice of training for fitness at Lufula, a resolution was passed to register in one of the leagues in Uganda, NAKAWA DISTRICT LEAGUE [Fifth Division]. With this, the club pressed, not only into the social scene but into the football lights, too.

                From the Fifth Division, CATDA FC was promoted to the Fourth Division instantaneously however later in 2017/2018, FUFA, the football governing body, merged the Fifth Division into the NAKAWA DISTRICT FOURTH DIVISION LEAGUE, and as thus by default, this automatically qualified and promoted us to THIRD DIVISION and we thereby became a member of KAMPALA REGION FA.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Our first season in the 3rd Division was well; as we finished runners up.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the previous season 2018/2019, we participated in the KAMPALA REGIONAL FA League as the “new entrant(s)” and as thus, successfully emerged second (2nd) after Katwe United Football Club.
                In the Uganda Cup that season, we travelled and played against Nebbi Central at the Round of 64 stage where we were eliminated, 3-2 in Nebbi.

              </p>
              <p>
                As the second leg of the league resumes, the Club is up and running to prosper all its activities and it is for this reason that we address and desire to have the brand as a sponsor.
